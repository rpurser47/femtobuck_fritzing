FemtoBuck LED Driver Fritzing Part
==================================

Fritzing Part for the [SparkFun FemtoBuck](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12937)

Developed using Fritzing 0.9.1.  May or may not work with previous and future versions.

I created the breadboard and schematic versions of the femtobuck, but did not bother with the PCB rendering.  Honestly, Fritzing gave some strange errors that I couldn't figure out how to resolve, and I didn't need it.  If you are willing to contribute, feel free to send me a pull request.
